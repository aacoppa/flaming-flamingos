UPDATE
======

In world.c there are two functions:
    colliding and update_collision
They need to be filled in. The context they are used in is self-explanatory.

June 5th
* Create interface
    DONE - object struct
        * Different types of collision based on object id
    TODO - plane object (If we can... Used for boundaries)
        * type of object
